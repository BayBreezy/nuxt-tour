## Getting the Tour Instance

To get the tour instance, you can add a ref to the `VTour` component and then access the different methods on the instance.

```vue
<template>
  <VTour ref="tourRef" />
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
  import { VTour } from "#components";
  import type { TourStep } from "#nuxt-tour/props";

  const tour = ref<InstanceType<typeof VTour> | null>(null);

  onMounted(() => {
    // Now you can call the methods on the tour instance
    tour.value?.startTour();
  });
</script>
```

## Methods

Below are all the methods that the `VTour` component exposes.

### `startTour`

Starts the tour from the first step. This

If the `steps` prop is empty, the tour won't start

If the name of the tour in local storage is found and it's value is `true`, the tour won't start

### `endTour`

Ends the tour and set the the `name` of the tour in local storage to `true`

### `nextStep`

Moves to the next step in the tour

### `prevStep`

Moves to the previous step in the tour

### `goToStep`

Moves to a specific step in the tour. A number **MUST** be passed to this method.

### `resetTour`

This method removes the `name` of the tour from local storage and then calls the `startTour` method.

### `recalculatePopper`

This method recalculates the position of the popper element. This is useful when the target element changes position.

### `activateFocusTrap`

This method activates the focus trap. This is useful when you want to prevent the user from interacting with elements outside the tour.

### `deActivateFocusTrap`

This method deactivates the focus trap. This is useful when you want to allow the user to interact with elements outside the tour.
